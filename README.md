## Description

The goal of this assignment is to create an application that can be used to write, save, and delete notes entered by an end user. This application has both a front-end and back-end environment. The code for the front-end of the note taker application was already provided, so the main goal for students was to develop the back-end of the application and connect the developed back-end to the provided front-end code.

#### Reference Material

When developing this assignment, I reference and leverages the sample code provided in class for `Activity 15 - (Mini Project) Hot Restaurant`. Please note that I refactored / modified any leveraged code to meet the functionality needs for this note taker assignment.
